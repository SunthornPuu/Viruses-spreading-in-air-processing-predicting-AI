## 🚀 About This Project

This project predicts the airborne virus spreading potential by analyzing historical and forecast weather data. It calculates an **"X value"** that reflects the risk level based on temperature and relative humidity. The data can be further used to train AI models for more accurate future predictions.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- Select districts in Bangkok to view zone-specific risk levels  
- Fetches historical weather data (past 10 days) and forecast data (next 10 days)  
- Displays a scrollable, color-coded table indicating risk severity  
- Provides data foundation for training AI models on virus spread prediction

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed  
- Internet connection (for fetching weather data)

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy requests
```
### Step 2: Download Project Files

Make sure app.py and zones.py are in the same directory.

### Step 3: Run the Application
